# Fam
A community-building web app built by Galvanize WDI students for their Q2 project.

## Description

Every parent needs a community. Build yours using Fam!

Do you recall the difficulty of being a new parent and want to help out a new mom? Well now you can offer to help with things such as house cleaning or preparing a meal.

Are you a new mom struggling to keep up? Why not request a helping hand from somebody in your area? They could do everything from walking the dog to just giving you friendly company while you're at home taking care of the kids.

Sign-up today to start offering or requesting help!
